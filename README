Tkispell 


Tkispell is a Perl/Tk user interface to the GNU ispell program.


INSTALLATION

First make sure that GNU ispell is installed and works correctly on
your system.  Ispell is at: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ispell/, or in package
format for many Unixes.  Make sure that it is working correctly by
spell checking a file using the command line interface.

Then, follow the normal installation for Perl modules.

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ su
    # make install

There are a few options at the start of the tkispell script
that you can edit, namely, the X11 font (which must be
a X Logical Font Descriptor.  Refer to the xlsfonts(1) man page
for an explanation), and the name of your personal dictionary.

A description of the program's functions is contained in the program's
manual page: tkispell(1).


TROUBLESHOOTING

If tkispell prints an error message like:

  tkispell: file not found

edit the first line of 'tkispell with the path name of the system's
perl binary, normally /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl.  If perl
isn't in either place, try using the output of "which perl."

Tkispell is licensed under the same terms as Perl.  Please
refer to the file "Artistic."
