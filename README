Tkispell Version 0.13

Tkispell is a GUI interface to the GNU ispell program written
in Perl and the Perl/Tk widget libraries.

INSTALLATION

First make sure that GNU ispell is correctly installed on
your system.  If it isn't you can obtain the source code 
from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ispell/, or in package format for 
many unices.  If necessary, make sure that it's working 
correctly by spell checking a file using ispell's command
line interface.

After you've unpacked the archive (you're reading this, 
aren't you?), you will need to install the Tk-SimpleFileSelect
widget if it isn't already installed on your system.  You'll
need to be able to log in as root:

1.  Change to the Tk-SimpleFileSelect directory and build the 
    Makefile:

  $ cd Tk-SimpleFileSelect-<version>
  $ perl Makefile.PL

2.  Build the library module and documentation:

  $ make

3.  Become the superuser and install the module:

  $ su
  password: <enter the root password>
  # make install

Then there are three pathnames and one variable that 
you need to edit in the tkispell program for your 
system configuration:

1.  Line 1 must contain the full path name of the perl
    interpreter.  Usually it's "/usr/bin/perl" or 
    "/usr/local/bin/perl."  If neither of these work,
    use the output of the command, "which perl."
2.  On line 18, set the value of $font to whatever
    font you prefer.  The value of $font must be in
    X Logical Font Descriptor (XLFD) format.  Refer to 
    the manual page of "xfontsel" if you're not sure 
    how to specify X Window System fonts.
3.  Edit line 22 with the full pathname of the ispell
    program on your system.  On many systems it will be
    either "/usr/bin/ispell" or "/usr/local/bin/ispell,"
    but if neither of those work, use the pathname that
    is output by the command, "which ispell."
4.  Edit line 27 with the name of your personal ispell
    dictionary.  Ispell normally uses the name 
    .ispell_<language> and the dictionary is stored in
    your $HOME directory (which is what the perl 
    variable $ENV{HOME} provides; don't edit that unless
    you're sure of your personal dictionary's absolute
    path name).

Finally copy the tkispell program to a directory named by
the system's $PATH environment variable.  You'll need to 
be logged in as root to do this.  If you can't log in as 
root, you can still run tkispell from your $HOME directory;
simply type:

  $ ./tkispell 

instead of:

  $ tkispell

USAGE 

tkispell accepts one optional command line argument: the 
name of the file to be checked.  If you do not provide the
name of the file on the command line, you can open a file 
by clicking on the Browse... button and selecting a file
in the file selection widget.

Clicking on the "Check" button starts the spell check.  You'll see the
first misspelled word selected in the text box near the top of the
window, and the misspelled word entered in the entry box near the 
lower right of the window.  If ispell can guess at any replacement
words, those are listed on the left side of the window.  

The four buttons on the right side of the window provide the
actions that you can take for each misspelled word: 

- Accept: Don't change the word and move to the next misspelled
  word.
- Add: Add the misspelled word to your personal dictionary.
- Replace: Replace this instance of the misspelled word with 
  the correct word in the Entry box.
- Replace All:  Replace all instances of the misspelled word 
  with the corrected word in the entry box.

You can end the spell check at any point by clicking on the 
"Close" button.  Tkispell will ask you if you want to save the
spell checked file, renaming the original file with a ".bak"
extension if you click on "Ok" in the dialog box.  Then tkispell
will ask if you want to add the corrected words to your personal
dictionary.  Click on "Ok" or "Cancel."
